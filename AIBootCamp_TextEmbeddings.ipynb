        "Many people would say the breakthrough of deep learning in Natural Language Processing started with the introduction of word embeddings. Rather than using the words themselves as features, neural network methods typically take as input dense, relatively low-dimensional vectors that model the meaning and usage of a word. Word embeddings were first popularized through the [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) model, developed by Thomas Mikolov and colleagues at Google. Since then, scores of alternative approaches have been developed, such as [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/) embeddings. In this notebook, we'll explore word embeddings with the original Word2Vec approach, as implemented in the [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) library. "

        "- `min_count` is the minimum frequency of the words in our corpus. For infrequent words, we just don't have enough information to train reliable word embeddings. It therefore makes sense to set this minimum frequency to at least 10. In these experiments, we'll set it to 100 to limit the size of our model even more.\n",
        "- `window` is the number of words to the left and to the right that make up the context that word2vec will take into account.\n",
        "- `vector_size` is the dimensionality of the word vectors. This is generally between 100 and 1000. This dimensionality often forces us to make a trade-off: embeddings with a higher dimensionality are able to model more information, but also need more data to train.\n",
        "- `sg`: there are two algorithms to train word2vec: skip-gram and CBOW. Skip-gram tries to predict the context on the basis of the target word; CBOW tries to find the target on the basis of the context. By default, Gensim uses CBOW (`sg=0`).\n",

        "We mentioned above there are a number of parameters we can set when training our embeddings. Let's investigate the impact some of these have on the result. Quantifying the quality of embeddings is a hard task. There exist quite a few data sets for [evaluating the quality of English embeddings](https://github.com/kudkudak/word-embeddings-benchmarks), but this is not the case for other languages or very specialized domains, such as NLP. Moreover, it's unclear what information good embeddings should capture. Should they model syntactic information as well as semantic knowledge? Should they capture semantic similarity, or merely topical relatedness? Often, the answer depends on the end task you want to use the embeddings for. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here we'll use a simple method for evaluating our embeddings. We'll count how many times two nearest neighbours in the vector space have the same part of speech. After all, if our embeddings model similarity (and not just relatedness) in meaning, we expect a noun to have another noun as nearest neighbour, and the same for verbs, adjectives, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "First we'll use [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to determine the part of speech of all the words in our vocabulary. Note that our evaluation metric does rely on the quality of spaCy's part-of-speech tagging, which may not be very accurate for low-frequency words out of context. Nevertheless, we'll assume it's good enough for our purposes. "

        "Word embeddings are one of the most exciting trends on Natural Language Processing since the 2000s. They allow us to model the meaning and usage of a word, and discover words that behave similarly. This is crucial for the generalization capacity of many machine learning models. Moving from raw strings to embeddings allows them to generalize across words that have a similar meaning, and discover patterns that had previously escaped them."
